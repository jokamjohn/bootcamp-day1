# Asymptotic Analysis

[![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/jokamjohn/bootcamp-day1?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/)

The algorithm best case is O(1) 
 
The while loop runs N times and yet the other lines that execute are insignificant compared to the value of N. 
Therefore, the asymptotic analysis approximates to O(N).
